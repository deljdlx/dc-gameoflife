# 🍄 Game of life in a React old fashion way

<!--<SHORT-PRESENTATION>-->
A [Conway game of life implemention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implementation written in **(very) old-school React**, straight from the **prehistoric era of front-end development** (circa 2013).  

🦖 Featuring:
- `React.createElement(...)` – because hooks weren’t even a thing back then!  
- Inline styles like it’s **CSS apocalypse**  
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` – living on the edge!  

⚠️ **Warning:** This code may cause **severe nostalgia** or **mild disgust** among modern React developers.  

<!--</SHORT-PRESENTATION>-->

## The "game"

Try to **eliminate all the mushrooms** by clicking on the grid...  

🚨 **Warning:** This game is **highly frustrating** and may cause **rage-clicking**, existential crises, or an overwhelming desire to question your life choices.  

🍄 Mushrooms multiply in mysterious ways, and victory is more of a **concept than an achievable goal**.  

Good luck. You’ll need it.
